# About

My name is Peter Mortimer. I am a recent graduate from the "Data Engineering and Analytics" master program at the Technical University of Munich. In this blog I want to write about obscure roadblocks I have faced in different programming problems in the hopes of being of some use for someone stuck in a similar situation. My main interests lay in Machine Learning and Computer Vision.
