**“Visual Comparison of Isosurface Ensembles using Cutaway Views”**
<div class="row">
<div class="col-8 col-sm-8">
<p>In my bachelor thesis at the chair for Computer Graphics and Visualization I implemented novel visualization techniques to analyze ensemble data, particularly for the domain of weather data. The use of cutting geometries to create cutaway views allows one to reduce the visual clutter in the ensemble data without losing the overall visual context. I developed a demo and use case that allowed the placement of cutting geometries to create cutaway views.</p>

**“Recognition of Structural Motifs”**
<div class="row">
<div class="col-8 col-sm-8">
<p>In the practical course “Hands-On Deep Learning for Computer Vision and Biomedicine” we developed a fully convolutional network to detect realistic looking motifs in protein images of artificially constructed proteins. The motifs are represented as local features in the protein image, while the network output measured how realistic a particular motif looks compared to motifs found in known proteins</p>

**Summer Internship at Spirent Communications as a Data Scientist**
<div class="row">
<div class="col-8 col-sm-8">
<p>During a 10 week summer internship I worked on two data science projects using the call detail record data of a large mobile network carrier in North America. The projects revolved around relating customer experience metrics to their overall mobile usage and detecting long-distance travellers based on their mobile usage.</p>
<p><b>Technologies:</b> Python, SQL</p>

**Development of a Car Detector**
<div class="row">
<div class="col-8 col-sm-8">
<p>In the course “Introduction to Image Analysis and Machine Learning” at the IT University of Copenhagen we developed a car detector as a final project. The car detector could detect cars driving along a highway. We used traditional image analysis techniques to detect image patches that potentially contain cars and then used a convolutional neural network to classify the image patch.</p>

**3D Instances from a single RGB Image**
<div class="row">
<div class="col-8 col-sm-8">
<p>n my master thesis, I worked on using deep learning to detect the placement of 3D objects within a scene from a single RGB image of the indoor scene. I compared the predictive performance of using a point cloud object representation to a factored 3D object representation as output of the network architecture.</p>
