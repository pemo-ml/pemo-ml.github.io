# Blogroll

I really got into reading when I started going to university. Here is a simple list of some of my favorite books and I'll add some comments to some of them. This list is inspired by the [book list](http://jsomers.net/#books) of the writer and programmer James Somers. The books do not have a particular order and are only loosely organized by theme and genre.
Here is a list of my favorite blogs and I will add some comments to some of them. This list is inspired by the [book list](http://jsomers.net/#books) of the writer and programmer James Somers, but reimagined for blogs. The blogs are categorized based on the general theme the blogger normally writes about.
