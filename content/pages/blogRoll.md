# Blogroll

Here is a list of my favorite blogs and I will add some comments to some of them. This list is inspired by the [book list](http://jsomers.net/#books) of the writer and programmer James Somers, but reimagined for blogs. The blogs are categorized based on the general theme the blogger normally writes about.
