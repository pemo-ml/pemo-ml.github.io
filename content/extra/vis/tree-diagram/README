-------------------

This README gives a brief overview of the folder structure and the data format used in the TAS500 dataset.

Folder structure
----------------

The dataset includes the following directories:

test - The input images of the test split of the dataset (15%), the groundtruth is not publicly available and will be used for evaluation on a public leaderboard in the upcoming months.
train - The input images of the training split of the dataset (70%).
train_labels - The groundtruth segmentation maps in color for the training split of the dataset. See further below in the README for the class definitions and colors.
train_labels_ids - The groundtruth segmentation map of the training split as a grayscale image with the defined class IDs. See further below in the README for the class IDs.
val - The input images of the validation split of the dataset (15%).
val_labels - The groundtruth segmentation maps in color for the validation split of the dataset. See further below in the README for the class definitions and colors.
val_labels_ids - The groundtruth segmentation map of the validation split as a grayscale image with the defined class IDs. See further below in the README for the class IDs.
